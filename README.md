The code was written in Python and designed to be run in an iPython Notebook or Jupiter Notebook environment. The code is made available for transparency reasons. At present, it is not intended to be readily usable on different datasets. Also, it was not annotated and compiled to be user-friendly. Please, contact me privately for any inquiry related to the code usage.
